### Git Basics Learned

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repo-url>`: Create a copy of a remote repository locally.

- `git commit -m "message"`: Save staged changes to the repository with a message.
- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `git diff`: Show changes between working directory and staging/staged files.
- `git branch`: List local branches (use `git branch <name>` to create a new one).
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch to the specified branch.
- `git switch <branch>`: Alternative to `checkout` for switching branches.
- `git merge <branch>`: Merge the specified branch into the current branch.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
- `git fetch`: Download changes from the remote without merging.
- `git push`: Upload local commits to the remote repository.
- `git remote -v`: View remote repository URLs.
- `git reset <file>`: Unstage a file without discarding changes.
- `git reset --hard <commit>`: Reset to a commit and discard all changes.
- `git revert <commit>`: Create a new commit that undoes a specific commit.
- `git stash`: Temporarily save changes without committing.
- `git stash pop`: Reapply stashed changes and remove them from stash list.
- `git rm <file>`: Remove a file from the repository and working directory.
- `git tag <tag-name>`: Create a tag for a commit (often used for releases).
